              <span>Between the eyebrows.</span>Find the spot right between your eyebrows, above the bridge of your nose. Gently massage the spot, using small circular motions.
              <p><span>Between the thumb and index finger. </span>The webbing between thumb and index finger contains a stress-relieving pressure point. Gently pinch the spot between your opposite thumb and forefinger, holding the position.<span>Between your big toe and second toe.</span> Target the webbing between your first two toes, like the webbing on your hand.

              Binaural beats are a perception of sound created by your brain. If you listen to two tones, each at a different frequency and each in a different ear, your brain creates an additional tone you can hear. This third tone is called a binaural beat</p>
            <p>Listening to 40-Hz binaural beat can induce gamma oscillation in several brain areas. Those induced areas are related to auditory response of the brain. Moreover, beta and high beta oscillations are also induced by gamma oscillation in several associated areas, particularly frontal region.</p>

               A Step-by-Step Guide to Reduce Stress and Find Inner Peace In today’s fast-paced and chaotic world, finding inner peace and reducing stress can seem like an impossible task, which is why we want to help you learn how to meditate. One practice that has gained significant popularity and proven effectiveness is mindfulness meditation. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of incorporating mindfulness meditation into your daily routine.</p>
            <p>
                <span>Step 1:</span> Find a quiet and comfortable space to sit or lie down without distractions. Ensure that you have enough time to devote to the practice without feeling rushed.
                <span>Step 2:</span> Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax and your mind to settle. Focus on your breath, the sensation of air flowing in and out of your nostrils.
                <span>Step 3:</span> As you continue to breathe, pay attention to the thoughts, feelings, and sensations that arise in your mind and body. Don’t judge or try to change anything; simply observe them with curiosity and acceptance.
                <span>Step 4:</span> When your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to your breath, using it as an anchor to the present moment. This process of repeatedly returning your focus builds concentration and awareness.
                <span>Step 5:</span> Gradually expand your awareness to include the sensations in your body, the sounds around you, and the environment you are in. Embrace everything that arises with non-judgmental awareness.
                <span>Step 6:</span> Continue practicing mindfulness meditation for at least 10 minutes daily, gradually increasing the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>Stress affects both the mind and the body. A little bit of stress is
              good and can help us perform daily activities. Too much stress can
              cause physical and mental health problems. Learning how to cope with
              stress can help us feel less overwhelmed and support our mental and
              physical well-being.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="question1">What are signs of stress?</button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Stress makes it hard for us to relax and can come with a range of
              emotions, including anxiety and irritability. When stressed, we may
              find it difficult to concentrate. We may experience headaches or
              other body pains, an upset stomach or trouble sleeping. We may find
              we lose our appetite or eat more than usual. Chronic stress can
              worsen pre-existing health problems and may increase our use of
              alcohol, tobacco and other substances. Stressful situations can also
              cause or exacerbate mental health conditions, most commonly anxiety
              and depression, which require access to health care. When we suffer
              from a mental health condition, it may be because our symptoms of
              stress have become persistent and have started affecting our daily
              functioning, including at work or school.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="question1">Should we expect to be stressed in difficult situations?</button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes, it is natural to feel stressed in challenging situations such
              as job interviews, school exams, unrealistic workloads, an insecure
              job, or conflict with family, friends or colleagues. For many people
              stress reduces over time as the situation improves or as they learn
              to cope emotionally with the situation. Stress tends to be
              widespread during events such as major economic crises, disease
              outbreaks, natural disasters, war, and community violence.</p>

            Stress affects both the mind and the body. A little bit of stress is
            good and can help us perform daily activities. Too much stress can
            cause physical and mental health problems. Learning how to cope with
            stress can help us feel less overwhelmed and support our mental and
            physical well-being.

            Stress makes it hard for us to relax and can come with a range of
            emotions, including anxiety and irritability. When stressed, we may
            find it difficult to concentrate. We may experience headaches or
            other body pains, an upset stomach or trouble sleeping. We may find
            we lose our appetite or eat more than usual. Chronic stress can
            worsen pre-existing health problems and may increase our use of
            alcohol, tobacco and other substances. Stressful situations can also
            cause or exacerbate mental health conditions, most commonly anxiety
            and depression, which require access to health care. When we suffer
            from a mental health condition, it may be because our symptoms of
            stress have become persistent and have started affecting our daily
            functioning, including at work or school.

            Yes, it is natural to feel stressed in challenging situations such
            as job interviews, school exams, unrealistic workloads, an insecure
            job, or conflict with family, friends or colleagues. For many people
            stress reduces over time as the situation improves or as they learn
            to cope emotionally with the situation. Stress tends to be
            widespread during events such as major economic crises, disease
            outbreaks, natural disasters, war, and community violence.
